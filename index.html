        I’m currently working as a customer support specialist for a startup
        company in the Marketing sector. I develop support documents to help
        customers be self-sufficient while resolving customer queries. Not only
        that, but I work with team members from across the globe to solve many
        more technical issues like bugs that require the engineering team.
        Coming from a technical background, I’ve developed analytical skills
        that have helped me troubleshoot issues and resolve them swiftly. This
        has also helped me to take initiative to provide very efficient
        solutions to issues and also make suggestions to help customers function
        better with their apps and software.
